the plaintext.pt contains the plain text which is of 32 characters, or can be less. In case the length is less than 32 the readPlainText function appends 0's at the end of the plaintext.
the key.key file contains the key which will be used to encrpty all the above lines of the plaintext.pt

To run the code, add the plain text in plaintext.pt
add the single line key in key.key

and run the code using python AES.py
